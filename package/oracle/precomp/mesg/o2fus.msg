//  system error occurred while attempting to read from the INTYPE file, or all
//  lines of the INTYPE file are blank lines or comment lines.

// *Cause: An internal OTT error occurred in the O2F component of OTT.
// *Action: Contact ORACLE customer support.
324,0,  "Unable to convert from the database character set to the compiler character set"
// *Cause: The name of a type, attribute, or method cannot be converted from
//  the client character set in effect when OTT was invoked to the compiler
//  character set (typically ASCII or EBCDIC).
// *Action: A name is translated first from the database character set to
//  the client character set, and then from the client character set to the
//  compiler character set.  The client character set is specified in a
//  platform-dependent manner (On UNIX platforms, the client character set
//  is specified by setting the NLS_LANG environment variable).  Use a
//  client character set that can be translated to the compiler character
//  set.  The compiler character set itself is one such character set.
//  Specify synonyms in the INTYPE file for any names of database objects
//  that cannot be successfully translated to the client character set.
325,0,  "None of the characters in a name were legal identifier characters"
//  *Cause: None of the characters in the name of a database entity could
//   be translated to a character that may begin a C or C++ identifier,
//   such as a letter or an underscore.
//  *Action: Specify an explicit translation for the name in the INTYPE
//   file.
326,0,  "Some characters in this name were not legal identifier characters"
//  *Cause: One or more characters in the name of a database entity could
//   not be translated to a character that may appear in a C or C++
//   identifier, such as a letter, an underscore, or a digit.  The
//   characters that could not be translated were replaced with
//   underscores.
//  *Action: Make sure that the name is spelled correctly, and that it is
//   terminated by a blank, the end of a line, or an equals sign ("=").
//   You may use the translated name with added underscores, or
//   you may specify an explicit translation for the name in the INTYPE
//   file.
327,0, "CASE option has an illegal value"
//  *Cause: The value given for the CASE option in the INTYPE file is
//   not legal.
//  *Action: Change the value given for the CASE option to one of the
//   following legal values: SAME, LOWER, UPPER, or OPPOSITE.
328,0, "Illegal INITFUNC name"
//  *Cause: The function name given for the INITFUNC option in the INTYPE
//   file is not a legal C or C++ identifier.
//  *Action: Specify the name of the INITFUNC function as a legal C or C++
//   identifier.  This name can be given in the INTYPE file, given on the
//  command line, or derived from the INITFILE name.
329,0, "Type or option specification expected"
//  *Cause: A type or option specification was expected in the INTYPE file,
//   but was not seen.
//  *Action: Check the INTYPE file for syntax errors.  Supply a type or
//   option specification.  A type specification begins with the word
//   TYPE.  An option specification begins with the word CASE, INITFILE,
//   or INITFUNC.
330,0, "Name exceeds 265 bytes in length"
//  *Cause: A name seen in the INTYPE file exceeds 265 bytes in length.
//  *Action: Choose a shorter name.
331,0, "A syntactically illegal name was seen in the INTYPE file"
//  *Cause: A syntax error occurred in a name used in the INTYPE file.
//  *Action: If the name is quoted, make sure that the quotes are at the 
//  beginning and at the end of the name.  If a period
//  (which separates a schema name from a type name) 
//  appears, make sure that the schema name and the type name are both
//  present.
332,0, "A database link may not appear in the name of a user-defined type"
//  *Cause: A database link was seen in the name of a user-defined type.  This feature is
//   not yet supported.
//  *Action: Declare the user-defined type in the database to which OTT connects.
333,0, "An unexpected token appeared where a keyword was expected in the INTYPE file"
//  *Cause: A keyword such as TYPE was expected in the INTYPE file, but
//  an incorrect or misspelled keyword was seen.
//  *Action: Verify that your TYPE specification obeys the syntax
//  described in your documentation.  Verify that your keyword is
//  spelled correctly.
334,0, "A user-defined type is listed more than once in the INTYPE file"
//  *Cause: The same name of a user-defined type appears in more than one 
//   type specification.  The duplicate specifications of the type name will
//   be ignored.
//  *Action: Put all of the information about the type, including all type name
//   and attribute name translations, in a single TYPE specification, and
//   eliminate the duplicate TYPE specifications.
335,0, "Internal error in O2F component of OTT"
//  *Cause: A request was made to generate declarations for all the types in the
//   database schema.  An internal error occurred when initiating access to the
//  *Cause: A request was made that all types in the database schema are to 
//   database.
//  *Action: List the types to be processed in an INTYPE file.
//   Contact ORACLE customer support.
336,0, "Error reported by subsystem:\n    "
//  *Cause: A request was made to generate declarations for all the types in a
//   database schema.  An error occurred in a subsystem when accessing the database.
//  *Action: Examine the error message reported by the sybsystem to
//   determine its cause.  List the types to be processed in an INTYPE file. 
337,0, "Schema not found, or no types found in schema"
//  *Cause: A request was made to generate declarations for all the types
//  in a database schema.  Either the schema was not found, no user-declared
//  types  were found in the schema, or unable to connect to Oracle.
//  *Action: Ensure that a login/password string was specified for OTT and that
//   the Oracle database can be accessed with it.  Ensure that the
//   USER_TYPES table contains at least one row.
338,0, "Illegal or missing package name"
// *Cause: A legal Java package name was expected following IN or PACKAGE or
// IN PACKAGE, but was not seen.
// *Action:  Use a legal Java package name.
