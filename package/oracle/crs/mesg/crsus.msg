// *Cause: The Oracle Clusterware was successfully upgraded to a version.
// *Action: None.
1006, 0, "The OCR location %s is inaccessible. Details in %s."
// *Cause: An error occurred while accessing the OCR.
// *Action: Use the ocrcheck command to validate the accessibility of the
//          device and its block integrity. Check that the OCR location in
//          question has the correct permissions. Determine whether this
//          behavior is limited to one node or whether it occurs across all of

// *Action: Determine the OCR configuration on the other nodes in the cluster 
//          on which Oracle Clusterware is running by using the ocrcheck
//          command. Run the ocrconfig command with the -repair option to
//          correct the OCR configuration on this node.

//          located.
// *Action: Verify that all voting files in the new configuration
//          are accessible on this node.

1642, 0,"Node %d is using a different configuration from the one used by this node; this node is terminating to preserve integrity; details at %s in %s"
// *Cause:  Another node in the cluster is using a different set of configuration values, such as misscount or voting files.  Inconsistency can result in data 
//          corruption, so this node is terminating to avoid data corruption.
// *Action: Collect Clusterware alert log and the CSSD log indicated in the message on all
//          nodes and contact Oracle Support Services.

/   2401-2499: Cluster Time Synchronization Service specific messages.
/              From clsdus.msg
/
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

2401, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service started on host %s."
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service successfully started on the
//         listed node.
// *Action: None.
/
2402, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service aborted on host %s. Details at %s in %s."
// *Cause:  The Cluster Time Synchronization Service aborted due to an internal
//          error. Check the Cluster Time Synchronization Service log file to
//          determine the cause.
// *Action: Determine whether the Cluster Time Synchronization Service has
//          auto-started.
/
2403, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service on host %s is in observer mode."
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service detected an active vendor time
//         synchronization service on at least one node in the cluster.
// *Action: Oracle Clusterware requires a time synchronization service in active
//          mode. Oracle Clusterware will work with a vendor service or the Cluster
//          Time Synchronization Service. If you want to change the Cluster Time
//          Synchronization Service to active mode, stop and deconfigure the vendor
//          time synchronization service on all nodes.
/
2404, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service detects that the local time is significantly different from the mean cluster time. Details in %s."
// *Cause: The difference between the local time and the time on the reference
//         node was too much to be corrected.
// *Action: Shutdown the Oracle Clusterware on the local node. Adjust the
//          clock via native platform or OS methods. Restart the Oracle
//          Clusterware on the local node. 
/
2405, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service on host %s is shutdown by user"
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service on listed node was
//         terminated by a user.
// *Action: None.
/
2406, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service timed out on host %s. Details in %s."
// *Cause:  A Cluster Time Synchronization Service action failed. The
//          information from the reference node was discarded.
// *Action: Verify all network connections between cluster nodes and repair any
//          problematic connections. If no network problems are found,
//          1. Run diagcollection.pl.
//          2. Contact Oracle Support Services.
/
2407, 0, "The new Cluster Time Synchronization Service reference node is host %s."
// *Cause:  A new Cluster Time Synchronization Service reference node has been elected.
// *Action: None.
/
2408, 0, "The clock on host %s has been updated by the Cluster Time Synchronization Service to be synchronous with the mean cluster time."
// *Cause:  The clock was updated to be in sync with the mean cluster time.
// *Action: None.
/
2409, 0, "The clock on host %s is not synchronous with the mean cluster time. No action has been taken as the Cluster Time Synchronization Service is running in observer mode."
// *Cause: The clock was not in sync with the mean cluster time. No action has
//         been taken as Cluster Time Synchronization Service is running in
//         observer mode.
// *Action: Verify correct operation of the vendor time synchronization service
//          on the node.
/
2410, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service on host %s is in active mode."
// *Cause: The Cluster Time Synchronization Service did not detect an active
//         vendor time synchronization service on any node in the cluster.
// *Action: None. If a vendor time synchronization service is preferred to the
//          Cluster Time Synchronization Service, then configure and start the
//          vendor time synchronization service on all nodes to change the
//          Cluster Time Synchronization Service to observer mode.
/
2411, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service will take a long time to perform time synchronization as local time is significantly different from mean cluster time. Details in %s."
// *Cause: The difference between the local time and the time on the reference
//         node was too much to be synchronized in a short period.
// *Action: (Optional) Shutdown and restart the Oracle Clusterware on this node
//          to instantaneously synchronize the time with the reference node.
/
2412, 0, "The Cluster Time Synchronization Service detects that the local time is significantly different from the mean cluster time. Details in %s."
// *Cause: The difference between the local time and the time on the reference
//         node was too large. No action has been taken as the Cluster Time
//         Synchronization Service was running in observer mode.
// *Action: Verify correct operation of the vendor time synchronization service
//          on the node. Alternatively, if you want to change the Cluster
//          Time Synchronization Service to active mode, stop and
//          deconfigure the vendor time synchronization service on all nodes.

// to violate a pool size constraint, as indicated.
// *Action: Either change the pool size constraint(s) to accommodate your intent with this move, or 
// choose a different server to move.
2746, 1, "Cannot act on the instance of resource '%s' which is last known to have run on '%s' where Cluster Ready Services are not properly functioning"
// *Cause: The resource had been running on the server in the past but currently there's no way to know 
// if it's still running there because the Cluster Ready Services daemon does not appear to be
// running on the server. To prevent possible configuration violation,
// any attempt to start the resource instance on another server is rejected.
// *Action: The underlying problem preventing Cluster Resource Services on the server from 
// functioning properly must be addressed. Only then the resources that used to run there 
// can be operated on again. Alternatively, the server may be shut down or the clusterware stack 
// on it stopped completely.
2747, 1, "Server reconfiguration has failed to stop resources '%s' on server '%s'. Resources that did not stop must be stopped or unregistered manually. Details at %s in %s."

08000, 0, "unable to obtain local host name for reboot advisory log file scan"
// *Cause:  An attempt to retrieve the local host name failed.  The scan
//          for reboot advisory files will not use host name criteria and so
//          may report occurrences for other nodes as well as this one.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08001, 0, "an error occurred accessing reboot advisory log file location: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files was unable to access the
//          indicated file system location.  The location was skipped, so
//          any reboot advisory files that it contains will not be reported.
//          This message is accompanied by CLSU- messages containing

// *Action: Respond based on the error described by the accompanying CLSU-

//          changing its permissions.
/

08002, 0, "an error occurred searching reboot advisory log file location: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files was unable to read the next

// *Action: Respond based on the error described by the accompanying CLSU-
//          messages.
/

08003, 0, "reboot advisory log file: %s is unexpectedly empty"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files encountered a file that
//          was empty.  This might happen (rarely) if a component is
//          initializing its use of reboot advisory at the same time the scan
//          is running.  Processing of other files in the location continues.
// *Action: Frequent occurrence of this message should be reported to
//          Oracle Support Services.
/

08004, 0, "an error occurred reading reboot advisory log file: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files experienced a read error
//          on a reboot advisory file.  No further processing is done for that
//          file, but the scan continues with other files.  This message
//          is accompanied by CLSU- messages containing details of the
//          read error.
// *Action: Respond based on the accompanying CLSU- messages.
/

08005, 0, "an error occurred closing reboot advisory log file: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files experienced a close error on

// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08006, 0, "an error occurred opening reboot advisory log file: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files experienced an error when it
//          opened a reboot advisory file.  The scan continues with other files.
//          This message is accompanied by CLSU- messages containing details
//          of the open error.
// *Action: If the error indicated in the accompanying CLSU- messages is one that
//          can be corrected, do so.  Otherwise, report this error to Oracle
//          Support Services.
/

08007, 0, "an error occurred closing reboot advisory log file location: %s"
// *Cause:  The scan for reboot advisory log files experienced an error when it
//          closed the indicated file system location.  Processing of other
//          reboot advisory locations (if any) continues normally.
//          This message is accompanied by CLSU- messages containing
//          details of the close error.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08008, 0, "%s"
// *Cause:  Operating system error data related to reboot advisory file
//          processing was returned.  The error data is packaged in a CLSU- message
//          that follows "CRS-08008:".  One or more of these messages
//          appears after a message announcing the error condition.
// *Action: Look up the embedded CLSU- message for an explanation of the
//          operating system error data.  If there is no CLSU- message ID present,
//          contact Oracle Support Services.
/

08009, 0, "reboot advisory log file: %s contains invalid data (length %d, error code %d)"
// *Cause:  A reboot advisory log record read from the indicated file contained
//          incorrect data.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08010, 0, "invalid network reboot advisory message detected (length %d, error code %d)"
// *Cause:  A reboot advisory record received over the network was improperly
//          formed or contained incorrect data.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08011, 0, "reboot advisory message from host: %s, component: %s, with time stamp: %s"
// *Cause:  A reboot advisory message was detected.  During Oracle Clusterware
//          startup on a given host, messages recently written to disk on that host
//          before a reset or reboot are detected and announced.  Subsequently,
//          network reboot advisory messages may be announced as they occur.  These
//          are reported by hosts other than the one being reset or rebooted.
//          This message is accompanied by other messages containing details on
//          what led to the reset or reboot.  The time stamp in this message
//          begins with either 'U' (denoting UTC time) or 'L' (denoting
//          local time as viewed by the issuing host).  Note that a given
//          reset or reboot event can produce multiple occurrences of these
//          messages on multiple hosts in the cluster.
// *Action: Use the reboot advisory message(s) to determine why Oracle Clusterware
//          caused a reset or reboot of the affected host, and respond
//          accordingly.  Refer to the discussion of reboot advisories in the
//          Oracle Clusterware administration documentation for additional
//          guidance.
/

08012, 0, "reboot advisory message from a higher Oracle Clusterware version detected"
// *Cause:  A reboot advisory message from a higher version installation of
//          Oracle Clusterware was detected.  This is an expected
//          occurrence with network reboot advisories when there are nodes with
//          a higher Oracle Clusterware version than this node (such as during
//          an upgrade).  It is an unexpected condition with file reboot
//          advisories.
// *Action: The reboot advisory message is displayed in a following CRS-08013
//          message in a "raw" text form.  In the case of network reboot
//          advisories, the explanatory message text should be readable and
//          useful to determine the cause of the node reboot.  If the
//          reboot advisory message is from a file, report this message to
//          Oracle Support Services.
/

08013, 0, "reboot advisory message text: %s"
// *Cause:  An explanatory text message associated
//          with a reboot advisory announced in a preceding CRS-08011 or CRS-08012
//          message was displayed.  These text messages are always written in US English
//          locale.
// *Action: Refer to the descriptions of messages CRS-08011 and -08012, and
//          to the Oracle Clusterware documentation on reboot advisories.
/

08014, 0, "reboot advisory binary data (%d bytes%s) follows:"
// *Cause:  Binary data associated with a reboot advisory message was displayed.
//          It is followed by one or more lines of CRS-08015 message containing
//          the binary data formatted in hexadecimal.  If an asterisk appears
//          inside the parentheses, an invalid data length was detected.
// *Action: Refer to the description of message CRS-08011 and -08012, and
//          to the Oracle Clusterware documentation on reboot advisories.
/

08015, 0, "%04X    %s"
// *Cause:  Hexadecimal display of binary data included in a reboot advisory log
//          message was displayed.  The first number is an offset and is
//          followed by up to 16 bytes of data.
// *Action: Refer to the description of message CRS-08011 and -08012, and
//          to the Oracle Clusterware documentation on reboot advisories.
/

08016, 0, "an error occurred determining the location for reboot advisory log files"
// *Cause:  The search for reboot advisory log files was unable to determine
//          the file system location used for those files.  Processing
//          of reboot advisory files is skipped.  This message is accompanied
//          by CLSU- messages containing failure details.
//          This is an internal error.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
/

08017, 0, "location: %s has %d reboot advisory log files, %d were announced and %d errors occurred"
// *Cause:  This summary message is written during Oracle Clusterware startup if
//          one or more reboot advisory log files was found and examined.
// *Action: This message is informational, but if the error count is nonzero
//          the associated messages (earlier in the alert log) should be examined.
/

08018, 0, "warning: missing cluster identity data for reboot advisory message validation"
// *Cause:  During Oracle Clusterware start up, an attempt to obtain the identity of
//          the cluster failed.  Processing continues normally, but network
//          reboot advisories from nodes in other clusters may be reported in
//          this cluster's alert log.
// *Action: Report this error to Oracle Support Services.
