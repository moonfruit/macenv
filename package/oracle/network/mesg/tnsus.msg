/ NAME
/   netius.msg - NETwork Internal message file - U.S. english version
/
/
/ FUNCTION
/   Internal network error message file, American English version.
/
/
/ NOTES
/       Only internal errors are to be put into this file. External
/       messages are to put into netus.msg.
/
/       This file, along with netus.msg, forms tnsus.msg. As a result, the
/       errors in this file may not overlap with the errors in that file.
/       Otherwise, errors will result when generating tnsus.msb.
/
/       Message text should be limited to a maximum of 76 characters.
/       Messages containing embedded % directives should not overrun
/       the 76 character limit unless they signal unusual errors
/       which do not occur as part of user applications.  For example,
/       startup errors and system-dependent errors can probably get
/       away with longer message text.
/
/
/       '/' at beginning-of-line for comments.
/       '//' at beginning-of-line for *Cause: and *Action: fields.

/ Start with error messages first.
/
00001, 00000, "INTCTL: error while getting command line from the terminal"
// *Cause: Improper standard input connection from the terminal.
// *Action: Normally not visible to the user. Start the INTCTL program again.
// If error persists, contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
00002, 00000, "INTCTL: error while starting the Interchange"
// *Cause: The Interchange could not be started.
// *Action: Check the Interchange configuration files (INTCHG.ORA, TNSNET.ORA
// and TNSNAV.ORA) for errors and confirm that no other programs are using
// the ADDRESS(es) specified. If error continues, turn on tracing in the
// Interchange components and examine the trace files to determine the
// cause of the problem. Be sure to turn tracing off when the problem has been
// rectified.
/
00003, 00000, "INTCTL: error while sending request to the Interchange"
// *Cause: Improper command sent to the Interchange or the Interchange
// is not responding. Not normally visible to the user.
// *Action: Verify that the command sent to the Interchange is valid.
// Also check that the Interchange is running by using the INTCTL STATUS
// command. If necessary, start the Interchange using the INTCTL START
// command.
/
00004, 00000, "INTCTL: error while starting the Navigator"
// *Cause: The Navigator could not be started.
// *Action: Check to make sure that executables for the Navigator (navgatr)
//  are present in the ORACLE executable directory on
//  your platform. Check the configuration files TNSNET.ORA and TNSNAV.ORA
//  for errors. If error continues, turn on tracing in the Interchange
//  components and examine the trace files to determine the cause of the
//  problem. Be sure to turn tracing off when the problem has been
//  rectified.
/
00005, 00000, "INTCTL: error while sending request to the Navigator"
// *Cause: The Navigator is not responding. Either the Navigator is not
// running or another process is responding.
// *Action: Check that the Navigator is running by using the STATUS command
// of the Interchange Control Utility. Verify that the correct addresses
// are listed in the TNSNAMES.ORA, TNSNET.ORA, and TNSNAV.ORA configuration
// files.

// *Cause: The pointer HOST is set to an unknown hostname.
// *Action: Set the pointer HOST properly and restart INTCTL program.
/
00008, 00000, "INTCTL: could not contact destination Navigator"
// *Cause: Connection could not be properly established to a Navigator.
// This may be because the Navigator specified is not running or the Navigator
// addresses are incorrect.
// *Action: Check that the Navigator is running by using the STATUS
// command of the Interchange Control Utility; if necessary, start the
// Navigator using the START command of the Interchange Control Utility.
// If it is running and the error persists, contact Oracle Customer
// Support.
/
00009, 00000, "INTCTL: could not contact destination Connection Manager"
// *Cause: Connection could not be properly established to a Connection
// Manager.  This may be because the Connection Manager (Interchange)
// specified is not running or the Connection Manager addresses are incorrect.
// *Action: Make sure the Connection Manager is running by using the STATUS
// command of the Interchange Control Utility; if necessary, start the
// Connection Manager using the START command of the Interchange Control
// Utility. If it is running and the error persists, contact Oracle Customer
// Support.
/
00010, 00000, "Error while flushing NS context"
// *Cause: Internal NS error; connection may be lost.
// *Action: Make sure the connection is properly established.  If the
// error persists, then contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
00011, 00000, "INTCTL: error while starting the Connection Manager"
// *Cause: The Connection Manager could not be started.
// *Action: Assure that the executable can be found in the standard Oracle
// executable area. Check the configuration file INTCHG.ORA for errors and
// confirm that no other process is using the ADDRESS(es) for this
// Connection Manager as specified in TNSNET.ORA.
// Tracing can also be turned on in the Connection Manager and detailed
// information about the reason for the error determined. Consult the
// MultiProtocol Interchange Administrator's Guide and Chapter 2 of this
// manual for how to turn on tracing.
/
00012, 00000, "INTCTL: error while processing Connection Manager request"
// *Cause: An improper command was sent to the Connection Manager or it is not
// responding. Not normally visible to the user.
// *Action: Verify that the correct addresses are listed in the
// TNSNAMES.ORA, TNSNET.ORA, and TNSNAV.ORA configuration files.  Also check
// that the Connection Manager is running by using the STATUS command of
// the Interchange Control Utility. If the error persists, contact
// Oracle Customer Support.
/
00013, 00000, "INTCTL: error while performing NS disconnect command"

// *Cause: Configuration files do not contain an ADDRESS/ADDRESS_LIST
// component.
// *Action: Define the Connection Manager ADDRESS(es) in the TNSNET.ORA
// file and check the Navigator ADDRESS(es) in the TNSNAV.ORA file,
// then restart the INTCTL program.
/
00024, 00000, "INTCTL: Unable to contact Navigator to obtain Connection Manager address"
// *Cause: The Navigator is not running.
// *Action: Verify that the Navigator is running by doing a status
// request on the Navigator (use the Interchange Control Utility command
// STATUS). If necessaary, start the Navigator using the Interchange
// Control Utility. Verify that the network is properly configured;
// if the error persists, contact Worldwide Customer Support.
/
00025, 00000, "INTCTL: The ORACLE environment is not set up correctly"
// *Cause: The ORACLE environment is incorrectly set up.
// *Action: Refer to the Oracle operating system specific documentation for
// your platform for information on how the ORACLE environment should be set.
// Correct it and rerun INTCTL. Make sure the ORACLE environment includes
// the correct directories.
/
00026, 00000, "INTCTL: TNS_ADMIN directory set, and is being used"
// *Cause: The TNS_ADMIN environment variable is set properly.  INTCTL will
// use the TNS_ADMIN directory.  This is only an informative message.  If
// you do not want it to be used, and want the default directory to be used
// instead, then unset TNS_ADMIN and reexecute.
// *Action: None.
/
00027, 00000, "INTCTL: Could not resolve Navigator's name/address"
// *Cause: The Navigator's name to address definition is missing.
// *Action: Check TNSNAMES.ORA file and make sure to include a definition for
// the name specified.
/
00028, 00000, "INTCTL: Could not resolve Connection Manager's name/address"
// *Cause: The Connection Manager's name does not have a definition that the
// Navigator knows about, nor is the name/address available in the
// TNSNAMES.ORA file. The name may also be incorrect in the INTCHG.ORA
// file.
// *Action: Verify that the Connection Manager's name is in the TNSNET.ORA
// file read by the Navigator or in the TNSNAMES.ORA file. Be sure that
// INTCHG.ORA is correct.
/
00031, 00000, "INTCTL: internal NT error"
// *Cause: Problem interfacing to the protocol adapters installed.
// *Action: Normally not visible to the user. Try starting INTCTL
// again.  If the error persists, check the product installation. If it is
// correct, contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
00032, 00000, "INTCTL: internal NS error"
// *Cause: Problem interfacing with TNS.
// *Action: Normally not visible to the user. Try starting INTCTL
// again.  If the error persists, check the product installation. If it is
// correct, contact Oracle Customer Support.

00034, 00000, "INTCTL: internal NR error"
// *Cause: Problem with internal Interchange routines.
// *Action: Normally not visible to the user. Try starting INTCTL
// again.  If the error persists, check the product installation. If it is
// correct, contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
00035, 00000, "INTCTL: error while constructing full file name"
// *Cause: Problem while constructing the full path for a file name because
// the path name to the file or the environment variables are
// incorrect. Files looked up include TNSNAMES.ORA, TNSNAV.ORA, INTCHG.ORA
// and the error files for the Navigator and Connection Manager.
// *Action: Check that all environment variables are defined correctly
// and that all configuration files exist in their correct places.
/
00036, 00000, "INTCTL: error reading from Navigator or Connection Manager error files"
// *Cause: Problem while reading from Navigator or Connection Manager error
// files generated by the Navigator or Connection Manager when they fail
// to start.
// *Action: Check that a standard Network Error directory exists and that all
// privileges on the directory are appropriate.
/
00037, 00000, "INTCTL: error opening Navigator or Connection Manager error files"
// *Cause: Failed to open Navigator or Connection Manager error files when
// they have failed to start.
// *Action: Check that a Network Error directory exists and that all
// privileges on the directory are appropriate.
/
00038, 00000, "INTCTL: Poorly formed address or command string"
// *Cause: An unacceptable string was encountered while attempting
// to send a message to either the Navigator or Connection Manager.
// The addresses provided for either the Navigator or Connection Manager
// may be incorrectly constructed.
// *Action: Check all address strings in configuration files (TNSNAMES.ORA,
// TNSNAV.ORA or TNSNET.ORA) and assure that they are properly formed.
// Regenerate the files, if possible. If
// all is correct, please contact Worldwide Customer Support.
/
00039, 00000, "INTCTL: error while spawning a process"
// *Cause: An error was encountered while spawning a process due to an
// internal operating system dependent problem. Machine resources may be
// limited.
// *Action: Retry command. Check permissions on Interchange
// executables and the current setting of the search path. If necessary,
// terminate other applications to free up machine resources. If the error
// persists, contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
00040, 00000, "INTCTL: failed to initialize trace context-  Continuing anyway"
// *Cause: Problem while opening specified trace file because of errors in
// INTCHG.ORA or because the user has incorrect privileges, or the file does
// not exist.
// *Action: Check the privileges on the configuration files and ensure that
// all of them exist in their proper locations.
/
00041, 00000, "INTCTL: Navigator already running.  Start operation cancelled"
// *Cause: There is a Navigator already running and listening on the same
// addresses.
// *Action: None; the Navigator is already running.
/
00042, 00000, "INTCTL: CMANAGER already running.  Start operation cancelled"
// *Cause: There is a Connection Manager already running and listening on
//  the same addresses.
// *Action: None; the Connection Manager is already running.
/
00043, 00000, "The CMANAGER has active connections, do you still want to stop it (y/n)?"
// *Cause: The CMANAGER that is being stopped has active connections going
//  through.  This is the confirmation message.
// *Action: Respond by pressing y or n. Answering y will cause the active
// database connection to be dropped; this is not generally recommended.
/
00044, 00000, "INTCTL: You must have an INTCHG.ORA file to contact the Connection Manager"
// *Cause: There was an attempt to contact a default Connection Manager
// (Interchange) where there was no INTCHG.ORA present in the correct
// directory.
// *Action: Create an INTCHG.ORA file.
// Make sure it is placed in the correct directory and includes the correct
// name for the Connection Manager you wish to contact.
/
00045, 00000, "INTCTL: Could not contact the Navigator on address"
// *Cause: There was an attempt to contact a Navigator on a specific address
//  which is not responding.
// *Action: Check the TNSNAV.ORA file for that address.  Or check that the
//  Navigator is actually listening on that address.
/
00046, 00000, "INTCTL: Could not contact the CMANAGER on address"
// *Cause: There was an attempt to contact a CMANAGER on a specific address
//  which is not responding.
// *Action: Verify that the TNSNET.ORA file contains that address.  Also check
// that the CMANAGER is actually listening on that address by using the INTCTL
// STATUS command. If necessary, start the Connection Manager using the INTCTL
// START command.
/
00060, 00000, "INTCTL: Bad command: only the STATUS command can be used on remote Interchanges"
// *Cause: The user entered a command that does not exist, or the user
// tried to make a request other than STATUS to a remote Interchange.
// *Action:  Check the MultiProtocol Interchange Administrator's Guide for
// a list of INTCTL commands or type HELP for a list of valid commands.
/
00061, 00000, "INTCTL: Bad command or syntax error: You must specify a trace level"
// *Cause:  The user did not specify a trace level.
// *Action:  Specify a trace level and retry command.
/
00062, 00000, "INTCTL: Bad command or syntax error: For help type help/h/?"
// *Cause:  The user entered an invalid command.
// *Action:  Check the MultiProtocol Interchange Administrator's Guide or type
// HELP for a list of valid commands.
/
00063, 00000, "INTCTL: Failed to allocate memory for buffers"
// *Cause:  INTCTL was unable to allocate memory for internal buffers.
// *Action:  Check the amount of available memory on your machine to ensure
//  that there is enough memory to run this executable. If necessary, free up

// is not installed; call Oracle Worldwide Support as the BEQ driver should
// always be installed. If this is not the problem then the error is probably

// *Action: Verify that the listener name or service name specified to
// LSNRCTL has the correct name and address defined in LISTENER.ORA or in
// TNSNAMES.ORA.
/
01103, 00000, "Protocol specific component of the address is incorrectly specified"
// *Cause:  The ADDRESS used to contact the listener is not correctly specified.
// This error occurs because the address fails to specify the destination
// of the listener. The address is well formed (for example, there are no
// missing parentheses) but it is missing a protocol specific component. For
// example, this is the error returned when the HOST component is missing from
// a TCP/IP address string.
// *Action: Edit the ADDRESS in LISTENER.ORA to include the required
// protocol-specific keywords.  For more information about the keywords
// required by different protocol adapters, see the Oracle operating system
// specific documentation for your platform.
/
01106, 00000, "Listener using listener name %s has already been started"

// *Action: Enter the listener password on a tty device
/
01109, 00000, "Listener password encryption failed"
// *Cause:  Possibly garbled password entered
// *Action: Re-enter the listener password, using valid ASCII characters. If
// problem persists, contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
01110, 00000, "Mismatch - password unchanged"
// *Cause:  New password and reentered new password are different"
// *Action: Re-enter the listener password, make sure that New password
// and reentered new password are the same
/
01111, 00000, "Log status can either be ON or OFF"
// *Cause:  Failed to specify a log status value for the LSNRCTL log_status command.
// *Action: Specify one of ON or OFF.

// this manual for an introduction to the concepts of logging.
01112, 00000, "Plug and play can either be ON or OFF"
// *Cause:  Failed to specify a valid value for the LSNRCTL use_plugandplay command.
// *Action: Specify one of ON or OFF.
// Type "LSNRCTL help set use_plugandplay" for more information.
/
01113, 00000, "save_config_on_stop can either be ON or OFF"
// *Cause:  Failed to specify a valid value for the LSNRCTL save_config_on_stop command.
// *Action: Specify one of ON or OFF.
// Type "LSNRCTL help set save_config_on_stop" for more information.
/
01114, 00000, "LSNRCTL could not perform local OS authentication with the listener"
// *Cause:  LSNRCTL failed to obtain system resources (heap memory, or shared 
// memory) needed to perform local OS authentication with the listener.
// *Action: Make sure that system resources like shared memory and heap memory
// are available for LSNRCTL tool to execute properly.
/
01115, 00000, "OS error %s creating shared memory segment of %s bytes with key %s"
// *Cause:  The shared memory segment could not be created as requested. For 
// example, a segment with the provided key may already exist, or the size may
// be outside of system allowed range.
// *Action: Use the error code to determine the exact cause of the problem. In
// certain cases the problem may be resolved by adjusting the system-imposed 
// limits such as the maximum number of allowed shared memory segments, or 
// their maximum and minimum sizes. In other cases, resources need to be freed
// up first for the operation to succeed.
/
01116, 00000, "Listener alias name given as connect identifier is too long"
// *Cause: The listener alias name you were attempting to resolve was too long. 
// *Action: The maximum length of a listener alias name is 255 bytes; this 
//          limit has been exceeded. Use a smaller listener alias name. 
/
01150, 00000, "The address of the specified listener name is incorrect"
// *Cause:  The address on which the listener attempted to listen contains a
// syntax error.
// *Action: For the listener name or service name specified to LSNRCTL, check
// that the address or connect descriptor is well-formed. You can find the
// listener name in LISTENER.ORA, or you can access the listener through
// the service name is TNSNAMES.ORA.
/
01151, 00000, "Missing listener name, %s, in LISTENER.ORA"
// *Cause:  The listener could not find the listener name specified.
// *Action: Make sure valid addresses on which to listen are specified for the
// listener name in LISTENER.ORA.
/
01152, 00000, "All addresses specified for the listener name, %s, failed"
// *Cause:  The listener failed to listen on any of the specified addresses.
// *Action: Make sure that another application is not listening on the addresses
// specified or check that the appropriate protocol adapters are installed.
// Turn on tracing and execute again for more information.
/
01153, 00000, "Failed to process string: %s"
// *Cause:  The string specified is not well-formed.
// *Action: Not normally visible to the user. For further details,
// turn on tracing and reexecute the operation.
// If error persists, contact Oracle Customer Support.
// *Comment: Do not include in error manual.
/
01154, 00000, "SID detected in old format that is no longer supported"
// *Cause:  One of the SIDs was specified in an obsolete format.
// *Action: Check LISTENER.ORA for a line of the form:
// <sid> = (SID=(ORACLE_HOME=<oracle_home>))        OR
// <sid> = (SID_DESC=(ORACLE_HOME=<oracle_home>))
// The above format is no longer supported and SID_LIST_<listener_name>
// format described in the Oracle9i Net Services Reference Guide should be used.
// For example,
// SID_LIST_LISTENER = (SID_LIST=(SID_DESC=(SID_NAME=<sid>)(ORACLE_HOME=<oracle_home>)))
/
01155, 00000, "Incorrectly specified SID_LIST_%s parameter in LISTENER.ORA"
// *Cause:  SID_LIST_<listener_name> in LISTENER.ORA has an error in it.
// *Action: Be sure this parameter is specified as described in the
// Oracle9i Net Services Reference Guide. For example,
// SID_LIST_LISTENER = (SID_LIST=(SID_DESC=(SID_NAME=<sid>)(ORACLE_HOME=<oracle_home>)))
/
01156, 00000, "Missing or inappropriate PROTOCOL, TIMEOUT or POOL_SIZE parameter from PRESPAWN_DESC"
// *Cause:  PRESPAWN_DESC in each SID_DESC does not have required fields.
// *Action: Be sure the parameters required for PRESPAWN_DESC are specified
// in each SID_DESC. For example,
// SID_LIST_LISTENER = (SID_LIST=(SID_DESC=(SID_NAME=<sid>)(PRESPAWN_MAX=5)(ORACLE_HOME=<oracle_home>)(PRESPAWN_DESC=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(POOL_SIZE=10)(TIMEOUT=30))))
// Add or correct these parameters in the LISTENER.ORA file
/
01157, 00000, "Can only listen on %d addresses - ignoring %s"
// *Cause:  Too many addresses were given to listen on.
// *Action: Reduce the number of addresses to listen on and use another
// listener to listen on the remaining addresses.
/
01158, 00000, "Internal connection limit reached, preventing dispatcher from connecting"
// *Cause:  The internal Oracle Net connection list is full. Too many
// dispatchers are connected to the listener; therefore, no more dispatchers
// are allowed to connect.
// *Action: For further details, turn on tracing and reexecute the
// operation. If error persists, contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
01159, 00000, "Internal connection limit has been reached; listener has shut down"
// *Cause:  The internal Oracle Net connection list is full. The listener is
// configured to use too many Oracle Net connections.
// *Action: Reduce the number of listen addresses or services connected to
// the listener. For further details, turn on tracing and reexecute the
// operation. If error persists, contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
01160, 00000, "Trace level was not specified"
// *Cause:  Failed to specify a trace level for the trace command.
// *Action: Specify one of OFF, USER, ADMIN, or SUPPORT.
// Users should not see this error if LSNRCTL is being used.
// *Comment: Do not include in error manual.
/
01161, 00000, "Spawn alias %s was not found. Check listener parameter file"
// *Cause:  The alias specified to spawn a program was not found in LISTENER.ORA.
// *Action: This is not seen in normal use of Oracle Net.
// *Comment: See the porting notes or internal documentation on how to have
// the listener spawn a process.
// Do not include in error manual.
/
01162, 00000, "Syntax error in the address resolved from the spawn alias: %s"
// *Cause:  The alias specified to spawn a program was not a valid NVstring.
// *Action: This is not seen in normal use of Oracle Net.
// *Comment: See the porting notes or internal documentation on how to have
// the listener spawn a process.
// Do not include in error manual.
/
01163, 00000, "Failed to spawn process: %s"
// *Cause:  The process failed to start correctly.
// *Action: This is not seen in normal use of Oracle Net.
// *Comment: Turn on tracing in the listener and execute again. This problem is
// most often caused by the executable specified to be missing from the PATH
// in the listener's environment. See the porting notes or internal documentation
// on how to have the listener spawn a process.
// Do not include in error manual.
/
01164, 00000, "No spawn alias sent to listener"
// *Cause:  The spawn command was issued without an alias.
// *Action: This is not seen in normal use of Oracle Net.
// *Comment: See the porting notes or internal documentation on how to have
// the listener spawn a process. Users should not see this error if LSNRCTL
// is being used.
// Do not include in error manual.
/
01165, 00000, "Spawn alias has no program name set in it"
// *Cause:  The spawn alias in LISTENER.ORA is incorrectly specified.
// *Action: This is not seen in normal use of Oracle Net.
// *Comment: Make sure the NAME component of the PROCESS description is set.
// Do not include in error manual.
/
01167, 00000, "The command %s is not supported by the listener contacted"
// *Cause:  The listener does not recognize the command.
// *Action: This is caused when a newer version of LSNRCTL contacts an old
// listener. Upgrade listener if executing this command is important.
/
01168, 00000, "Cannot allocate memory"
// *Cause:  Sufficient memory could not be allocated to perform the desired
// activity.
// *Action:  Either free some resource for TNS, or add more memory to the
// machine. For further details, turn on tracing and reexecute the operation.
/
01169, 00000, "The listener has not recognized the password"
// *Cause: The listener has the password security mechanism enabled and 
// requires the correct password to execute any command other than VERSION.
// The user attempted to issue one of the privileged administrative commands, 
// but could not be successfully authenticated with the password provided.
// *Action: If an authorized user is attempting the command, then use the 
// SET PASSWORD command at the LSNRCTL prompt with the listener password. 
// If you do not know the password, then you are trying to execute 
// an inappropriate command. 
/
01170, 00000, "Event detection broke for address: %s"
// *Cause:  The event detection mechanism for the address specified returned
// an error.
// *Action: Future attempts to detect events on this address will fail.
// The listener will deallocate the listen address and connections will no
// long be accepted for this address. This error is not normally visible
// to the user. For further details, turn on tracing and reexecute the operation.
// If error persists, contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
01171, 00000, "Event detection broke for dispatcher: %s"
// *Cause:  The event detection mechanism for the dispatcher specified returned
// an error.
// *Action: Future attempts to detect events on this dispatcher will fail.
// The listener will deallocate the dispatcher and connections will no
// long be redirected to this dispatcher. This error is not normally visible
// to the user. For further details, turn on tracing and reexecute the operation.
// If error persists, contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
01172, 00000, "Listener has shut down since all listen addresses have been deallocated"
// *Cause:  The event detection mechanism broke and caused all listen addresses
// to be removed.
// *Action: Error 1170 has occured and caused all the listen addresses to be
// deallocated. Since all the listen addresses have been removed,
// no more connections can be established to this listener so it shuts itself
// down. This error is not normally visible to the user. For further details, turn
// on tracing and reexecute the operation. If error persists, contact
// Oracle Customer Support.
/
01173, 00000, "Missing or inappropriate PRESPAWN_MAX parameter from SID_DESC"
// *Cause:  PRESPAWN_MAX in each SID_DESC does not have required fields.
// *Action: Be sure the parameters required for PRESPAWN_DESC are specified
// in each SID_DESC. For example,
// SID_LIST_LISTENER = (SID_LIST=(SID_DESC=(SID_NAME=<sid>)(PRESPAWN_MAX=15)(ORACLE_HOME=<oracle_home>)(PRESPAWN_DESC=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(POOL_SIZE=10)(TIMEOUT=30))))
// Add or correct these parameters in the LISTENER.ORA file
/
01174, 00000, "The sum of the POOL_SIZEs from each PRESPAWN_DESC is greater than the PRESPAWN_MAX"
// *Cause:  The minimum value for PRESPAWN_MAX should be the sum of the POOL_SIZEs.
// *Action: Be sure the parameters required for PRESPAWN_DESC are specified
// in each SID_DESC. For example,
// SID_LIST_LISTENER = (SID_LIST=(SID_DESC=(SID_NAME=<sid>)(PRESPAWN_MAX=15)(ORACLE_HOME=<oracle_home>)(PRESPAWN_DESC=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(POOL_SIZE=10)(TIMEOUT=30))(PRESPAWN_DESC=(PROTOCOL=ipc)(POOL_SIZE=5)(TIMEOUT=15))))
// Add or correct these parameters in the LISTENER.ORA file
01175, 00000, "Password unchanged\n"
// *Cause:  Unable to set the new password
// *Action: Be sure to see that the new password has legal ASCII 
// characters. Try to set the password again.
/
01176, 00000, "Error in loading the new parameter value\n"
// *Cause:  Illegal values given for the parameters 
// *Action: Make sure that the parameter values are valid
// refer to the manual for the legal values for paramters
/
01177, 00000, "Log Status is OFF. Log file/directory unchanged\n"
// *Cause:  Log status needs to be set ON  for changing the log file 
// *Action: use command set log_status ON to set the log status of the 
// listener ON. 
/
01178, 00000, "Trace Level is 0. Trace file/directory unchanged\n"
// *Cause:  Trace Level needs to be set for changing the trace file/directory 
// *Action: use command set trc_level ON to set the trace level 
/
01179, 00000, "Listener cannot load instance class \"%s\"\n"
// *Cause:  Instance tried to register as a class unknown to listener.
// *Action: check LISTENER.ORA and/or instance configuration, and reference
//  platform documentation to find the instance classes available for the
//  listener on this platform.
/
01180, 00000, "Missing listener object %s in Directory Server"
// *Cause:  The listener could not find the listener object specified.
// *Action: Make sure the listener object is present in the Directory
// Server.
/
01181, 00000, "Internal registration connection limit reached"
// *Cause:  The number of registration connections has reached the maximum.
// No more registrations are allowed until some of the existing registration
// connections are completed.
// *Action: Disconnect existing registration connections if they are no longer
// needed.
/
01182, 00000, "Listener rejected registration of service \"%s\""
// *Cause: Received registration information could not be processed because it
// was invalid, or an internal error occurred.
// *Action: Not normally visible to the user. For further details, turn on 
// tracing and restart the instance. If error persists, contact Oracle 
// Customer Support.
// *Comment: Do not include in error manual.
/
01183, 00000, "Listener rejected registration or update of instance \"%s\""
// *Cause: Received registration or update information could not be processed 
// because it was invalid, or an internal error occurred.
// *Action: Not normally visible to the user. For further details, turn on 
// tracing and restart the instance. If error persists, contact Oracle 
// Customer Support.
// *Comment: Do not include in error manual.
/
01184, 00000, "Listener rejected registration or update of service handler \"%s\""
// *Cause: Received registration or update information could not be processed 
// because it was invalid, or an internal error occurred.
// *Action: Not normally visible to the user. For further details, turn on 
// tracing and restart the instance. If error persists, contact Oracle 
// Customer Support.
// *Comment: Do not include in error manual.
/
01185, 00000, "Registration attempted from a remote node"
// *Cause: It was determined that the registering instance is not located on
// the same node as the listener. It is required that the instance be colocated
// with the listener for this type of service registration.
// *Action: Check the configuration of the registering instance. Ensure that
// local_listener parameter specifies only local listeners. Use 
// remote_listener parameter to specify remote listeners.
/
01186, 00000, "Client connection was dropped based on a filtering rule"
// *Cause: Listener was configured with a filtering rule which explicitly
// specified that the client connection should be terminated without returning 
// an error to the client.
// *Action: Modify the filtering rules if the client should be allowed access
// to the requested service.
/
01187, 00000, "No proxy service handler available"
// *Cause: One of the following conditions has occurred:
//         - the proxy service was not registered
//         - the proxy service was registered, but was blocking new connections
//         - all of the registered proxy service handlers were blocking new
//           connections
// *Action: If the proxy service is not registered it may need to be 
// restarted. If the proxy service handlers are busy and not accepting new 
// connections more of them may need to be started to handle the load.
/
01188, 00000, "Listener cannot operate with incompatible transport protocols"
// *Cause: Listener was configured with multiple listening addresses with 
// different and incompatible transport protocols. Listener cannot operate 
// efficiently in such configuration.
// *Action: Modify the existing listener configuration by removing the 
// listening address that caused the error. Configure a separate listener to 
// listen on this address.
/
01189, 00000, "The listener could not authenticate the user"
// *Cause: The user attempted to issue a privileged administrative command, but
// could not be successfully authenticated by the listener using the local OS 
// authentication mechanism. This may occur due to one of the following 
// reasons:
// 1. The user is running a version of LSNRCTL that is lower than the version
//    of the listener.
// 2. The user is attempting to administer the listener from a remote node.
// 3. The listener could not obtain the system resources needed to perform the 
//    authentication.
// 4. The local network connection between the listener and LSNRCTL was 
//    terminated unexpectedly during authentication message exchange, such as 
//    if LSNRCTL program was suddenly aborted.
// 5. The communication between the listener and LSNRCTL is being intercepted
//    by a malicious user.
// 6. The software that the user is running is not following the authentication
//    protocol, indicating a malicious user.
// *Action: Make sure that administrative commands are issued using the LSNRCTL
// tool that is of a version equal or greater than the version of the listener,
// and that the tool and the listener are running on the same node. You can 
// issue the VERSION command to find out the version of the listener. 
// If a malicious user is suspected, use the information provided in 
// the listener log file to determine the source and nature of the requests. 
// Enable listener tracing for more information. If the error persists, 
// contact Oracle Support Services.
/
01190, 00000, "The user is not authorized to execute the requested listener command"
// *Cause: Most of the listener administrative commands are only intended to 
// be issued by privileged users, for example DBAs or system administrators. 
// If the listener password is not set, then the listener only accepts 
// administrative requests from LSNRCTL running with the same OS credentials, 
// or running as a local administrator (also referred to as super user).
// *Action: If an authorized user is attempting the command, then make sure 
// that LSNRCTL is executed with the same OS user credentials as the running 
// listener, or as a local administrator.
/
01191, 00000, "Failed to initialize the local OS authentication subsystem"
// *Cause: Initialization of the security subsystem failed during listener 
// startup or reload. The listener could not obtain system resources (memory,
// or file descriptors) needed for local OS authentication security mechanism.
// *Action: Make sure that system resources like shared memory and heap memory
// are available for listener to execute properly. For further details, turn
// on tracing and execute the operation again. If the error persists, contact
// Oracle Support Services.
/
01192, 00000, "Missing SID_LIST_ value left of equation for SID description in LISTENER.ORA"
// *Cause: SID description in LISTENER.ORA had an error in it.
// *Action: Make sure the lines of code in LISTENER.ORA containing SID_DESC or 
// SID begin with SID_LIST_<listener_name> on the left side of the equation.
// For example,
// SID_LIST_LISTENER =(SID_LIST=(SID_DESC=(SID_NAME=<sid>)(ORACLE_HOME=<oracle_home>)))
/
01193, 00000, "Listener cannot operate with specified secure transport"
// *Cause: Listener was configured with transport protocols which are either
// invalid or none of the secure transport protocols are present in listening
// addresses.
// *Action: Modify the existing listener configuration by specifying a valid
// tranport protocol in secure transport list. 
/
01194, 00000, "The listener command did not arrive in a secure transport"
// *Cause: Most of the listener administrative commands are only intended to 
// be issued in a secure transport, which are configured in 
// secure_control_ parameter. If the parameter is set, then the listener
// accepts administrative requests only on those secure transports.
// *Action: Make sure the command is issued using a transport specified 
// in secure transport list.
/
01195, 00000, "Listener rejected registration of endpoint \"%s\""
// *Document: NO
// *Cause:  Registration information could not be processed because the
// specified endpoint is already registered and the new endpoint was
// incompatible
// *Action: Not normally visible to the user. For further details, turn on
// tracing and restart the instance. If error persists, contact Oracle
// Support Services.
/
01200, 00000, "The listener must be suid root"
// *Cause:  The ownership privileges of the TNSLSNR executable are incorrect.
// *Action: Contact your DBA or system administrator to change the ownership
// of the file to be suid root and restart the listener. This action is
// necessary because the user that started the process should claim
// ownership.
// *Comment: This error is reported only on Trusted Oracle platforms.
/
01201, 00000, "Listener cannot find executable %s for SID %s"
// *Cause:  The executable for the Oracle dedicated server process cannot be
// found.
// *Action: Check the appropriate SID_DESC in LISTENER.ORA to make sure that
// the ORACLE_HOME component is pointing to a valid location. If this component
// is not set, then check the value of the ORACLE_HOME environment variable.
// *Comment: This error is reported only on UNIX platforms.
/
01202, 00000, "Missing the dba group (%s) specified by DBA_GROUP in SID_DESC"
// *Cause:  The dba group specified is missing from /ETC/GROUP.
// *Action: Check the DBA_GROUP parameter in the SID_DESC in LISTENER.ORA
// and verify it has a valid entry in /ETC/GROUP.
// *Comment: This error is reported only on UNIX platforms.
/
01203, 00000, "Missing the account (%s) specified by DEFAULT_USER_ACCOUNT in SID_DESC"
// *Cause:  The unprivileged OS account is missing from /etc/passwd.
// *Action: Check the DEFAULT_USER_ACCOUNT parameter in the SID_DESC in
// LISTENER.ORA and verify it has a valid entry in /etc/passwd. This is
// the account that the  Oracle shadow process will be started with if the
// the connecting client has database  privileges or does not exist on this
// machine.
// *Comment: This error is reported only on UNIX platforms.
/
01204, 00000, "Unprivileged account (%s) is in dba group (%s)"
// *Cause:  The unprivileged account has DBA privileges. The unprivileged
// account specified by DEFAULT_USER_ACCOUNT in the SID_DESC in
// LISTENER.ORA is a member of the dba group specified  by DBA_GROUP in
// SID_DESC. The unprivileged account cannot belong to the dba group
// because this would be a security violation with OPS$ logins.
// *Action: Remove the unprivileged account from the dba group.
// *Comment: This error is only reported on UNIX platforms.
/

/ NOTES
/       Only external errors are to be put into this file. Internal
/       messages are to put into netius.msg.
/
/       This file, along with netius.msg and net12500.msg, forms tnsus.msg. As a

/       those files. Otherwise, errors will result when generating tnsus.msb.
/
/       Message text should be limited to a maximum of 76 characters.
/       Messages containing embedded % directives should not overrun
/       the 76 character limit unless they signal unusual errors
/       which do not occur as part of user applications.  For example,
/       startup errors and system dependent errors can probably get

// *Action: Reestablish connection. If the error is persistent, turn
// on tracing and reexecute the operation.
/
12153, 00000, "TNS:not connected"
// *Cause:  Not currently connected to a remote host.
// *Action: Reestablish connection.
/
12154, 00000, "TNS:could not resolve the connect identifier specified"
// *Cause:  A connection to a database or other service was requested using
// a connect identifier, and the connect identifier specified could not
// be resolved into a connect descriptor using one of the naming methods
// configured. For example, if the type of connect identifier used was a
// net service name then the net service name could not be found in a 
// naming method repository, or the repository could not be
// located or reached.
// *Action:
//   - If you are using local naming (TNSNAMES.ORA file):
//      - Make sure that "TNSNAMES" is listed as one of the values of the
//        NAMES.DIRECTORY_PATH parameter in the Oracle Net profile
//        (SQLNET.ORA)
//      - Verify that a TNSNAMES.ORA file exists and is in the proper
//        directory and is accessible.
//      - Check that the net service name used as the connect identifier
//        exists in the TNSNAMES.ORA file.
//      - Make sure there are no syntax errors anywhere in the TNSNAMES.ORA
//        file.  Look for unmatched parentheses or stray characters. Errors
//        in a TNSNAMES.ORA file may make it unusable.
//   - If you are using directory naming:
//      - Verify that "LDAP" is listed as one of the values of the
//        NAMES.DIRETORY_PATH parameter in the Oracle Net profile
//        (SQLNET.ORA).
//      - Verify that the LDAP directory server is up and that it is
//        accessible.
//      - Verify that the net service name or database name used as the
//        connect identifier is configured in the directory.
//      - Verify that the default context being used is correct by
//        specifying a fully qualified net service name or a full LDAP DN
//        as the connect identifier
//   - If you are using easy connect naming:
//      - Verify that "EZCONNECT" is listed as one of the values of the
//        NAMES.DIRETORY_PATH parameter in the Oracle Net profile

// Worldwide Customer Support.
/
12158, 00000, "TNS:could not initialize parameter subsystem"
// *Cause:  Unable to locate parameter file.
// *Action: Verify that a valid parameter file exists, and is readable.
/
12159, 00000, "TNS:trace file not writeable"
// *Cause:  The trace file to be generated is not writeable by this user.
// *Action: If the user does not have write permissions in the directory
// to which the trace file will be written, contact an administrator to
// get the proper permissions or set the TRACE_DIRECTORY_CLIENT
// parameter in the net profile (SQLNET.ORA file) to a directory the
// user can write to.
/
12160, 00000, "TNS:internal error: Bad error number"
// *Cause:  Corrupt error reporting subsystem.
// *Action: Not normally visible to the user. For further details, turn

// *Action: Reconnect and try again. For further details, turn
// on tracing and reexecute the operation. If error persists, contact
// Worldwide Customer Support.
/
12162, 00000, "TNS:net service name is incorrectly specified"
// *Cause:  The connect descriptor corresponding to the net service name in
// TNSNAMES.ORA or in the directory server (Oracle Internet Directory) is
// incorrectly specified.
// *Action: If using local naming make sure there are no syntax errors in
// the corresponding connect descriptor in the TNSNAMES.ORA file. If using
// directory naming check the information provided through the administration
// used for directory naming.
/
12163, 00000, "TNS:connect descriptor is too long"
// *Cause:  The connect descriptor corresponding to the net service name
// specified as the connect identifier is too long. The maximum length for
// a connect descriptor is 512 bytes and this limit has been exceeded.
// *Action: Check the net service name's connect descriptor in the local
// naming file (TNSNAMES.ORA) or in the directory server (Oracle Internet
// Directory). Use a smaller connect descriptor. If this is not possible,
// contact Worldwide Customer Support.
/
12164, 00000, "TNS:Sqlnet.fdf file not present"
// *Cause:  The sqlnet.fdf file doesn't exist in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin.
// *Action: The sqlnet.fdf file is required for Oracle Tracing to occur.
// Either install the sqlnet.fdf file in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin or
// turn off tracing in your ORA file.
/
12165, 00000, "TNS:Trying to write trace file into swap space."
// *Cause:  Oracle Trace doesn't allow writing trace information into your
// swap space.
// *Action: Oracle Trace cannot write trace information into swap space
// so either disable tracing or redirect trace files to be written to another
// area of your disk.
/
12166, 00000, "TNS:Client can not connect to HO agent."
// *Cause:  NVstring contained DESCRIPTION/HO.
// *Action: Call HO agent from integrating server.
/
12168, 00000, "TNS:Unable to contact LDAP Directory Server"
// *Cause:  Cannot contact LDAP directory server to get Oracle Net configuration.
// *Action: Verify that the directory server is up and accessible from the network.
//          Verify that directory access configuration is correct.  For more
//          information see the Oracle Internet Directory Administrators Guide or
//          the Oracle Net Administrators Guide.
/
12169, 00000, "TNS:Net service name given as connect identifier is too long"
// *Cause: The net service name you are attempting to resolve is too long.
// *Action: The maximum length of a net service name is 255 bytes; this limit
//          has been exceeded. Use a smaller net service name. If this
//          is not possible, contact Worldwide Customer Support.
/
12170, 00000, "TNS:Connect timeout occurred"
// *Cause:  The server shut down because connection establishment or
// communication with a client failed to complete within the allotted time
// interval. This may be a result of network or system delays; or this may
// indicate that a malicious client is trying to cause a Denial of Service
// attack on the server.
// *Action: If the error occurred because of a slow network or system,
// reconfigure one or all of the parameters SQLNET.INBOUND_CONNECT_TIMEOUT,
// SQLNET.SEND_TIMEOUT, SQLNET.RECV_TIMEOUT in sqlnet.ora to larger values.
// If a malicious client is suspected, use the address in sqlnet.log to
// identify the source and restrict access. Note that logged addresses may
// not be reliable as they can be forged (e.g. in TCP/IP).
/
12171, 00000, "TNS:could not resolve connect identifier: %s"
// *Cause:  A connection to a database or other service was requested using
// a connect identifier, and the connect identifier specified could not
// be resolved into a connect descriptor using one of the naming methods
// configured. For example, if the type of connect identifier used was a
// net service name then the net service name could not be found in a
// naming method repository, or the repository could not be
// located or reached.
// *Action:
//   - If you are using local naming (TNSNAMES.ORA file):
//      - Make sure that "TNSNAMES" is listed as one of the values of the
//        NAMES.DIRECTORY_PATH parameter in the Oracle Net profile
//        (SQLNET.ORA)
//      - Verify that a TNSNAMES.ORA file exists and is in the proper
//        directory and is accessible.
//      - Check that the net service name used as the connect identifier
//        exists in the TNSNAMES.ORA file.
//      - Make sure there are no syntax errors anywhere in the TNSNAMES.ORA
//        file.  Look for unmatched parentheses or stray characters. Errors
//        in a TNSNAMES.ORA file may make it unusable.
//   - If you are using directory naming:
//      - Verify that "LDAP" is listed as one of the values of the
//        NAMES.DIRETORY_PATH parameter in the Oracle Net profile
//        (SQLNET.ORA).
//      - Verify that the LDAP directory server is up and that it is
//        accessible.
//      - Verify that the net service name or database name used as the
//        connect identifier is configured in the directory.
//      - Verify that the default context being used is correct by
//        specifying a fully qualified net service name or a full LDAP DN
//        as the connect identifier
//   - If you are using easy connect naming:
//      - Verify that "EZCONNECT" is listed as one of the values of the
//        NAMES.DIRETORY_PATH parameter in the Oracle Net profile
//        (SQLNET.ORA).
//      - Make sure the host, port and service name specified
//        are correct.
//      - Try enclosing the connect identifier in quote marks.
//
//   See the Oracle Net Services Administrators Guide or the Oracle
//   operating system specific guide for more information on naming.

// machine, and verify that it lists the correct communities.
/
12208, 00000, "TNS:could not find the TNSNAV.ORA file"
// *Cause: Either the ORACLE environment is not set up correctly, or the
// TNSNAV.ORA file is not present.
// *Action: Ensure that the ORACLE environment is set up appropriately
// on your platform and that a TNSNAV.ORA file is present.
/
12209, 00000, "TNS:encountered uninitialized global"
// *Cause: Application calling navigation routine has not properly configured
// the global variables. There are no TNSNAV.ORA files available, or they

// *Action: Check that in the connect descriptors you are using either
// all the ADDRESSes have a COMMUNITY component or all do not.
/
/ All succeeding errors are a remap of NS errors in NR
/
12221, 00000, "TNS:illegal ADDRESS parameters"
// *Cause: An illegal set of protocol adapter parameters was specified. In
// some cases, this error is returned when a connection cannot be made to the
// protocol transport.
// *Action: Verify that the destination can be reached using the specified
// protocol. Check the parameters within the ADDRESS section of
// TNSNAMES.ORA or in the directory.  Legal ADDRESS parameter formats may
// be found in the Oracle operating system specific documentation or the
// Oracle Net Administrator's Guide. Protocols that resolve names at the
// transport layer are vulnerable to this error if not properly configured
// or names are misspelled.
/
12222, 00000, "TNS:no support is available for the protocol indicated"
// *Cause: The protocol requested in the ADDRESS portion of the connect
// descriptor identified through the net service name is not available.
// If the supplied ADDRESS is typographically correct then support for
// that protocol is not installed.
// *Action: Install support for the protocol or correct typographical error,
// as appropriate.  Note: if the supplied address was derived from
// resolving the net service name, check the address in the appropriate file
// (TNSNAMES.ORA, LISTENER.ORA) or in the directory server.
/
12223, 00000, "TNS:internal limit restriction exceeded"
// *Cause: Too many TNS connections open simultaneously.
// *Action: Wait for connections to close and re-try.
/
12224, 00000, "TNS:no listener"
// *Cause: The connection request could not be completed because the listener
// is not running.
// *Action: Ensure that the supplied destination address matches one of
// the addresses used by the listener - compare the TNSNAMES.ORA entry with
// the appropriate LISTENER.ORA file (or TNSNAV.ORA if the connection is to
// go by way of an Interchange). Start the listener on the remote machine.
/
12225, 00000, "TNS:destination host unreachable"
// *Cause: Contact can not be made with remote party.
// *Action: Make sure the network driver is functioning and the network is up.
/
12226, 00000, "TNS:operating system resource quota exceeded"
// *Cause: The current user has exceeded the allotted resource assigned in the
// operating system.
// *Action: Acquire more operating system resource, or perform a different
// function.
/
12227, 00000, "TNS:syntax error"
// *Cause: The supplied connect descriptor contains illegal syntax.
// *Action: Check the syntax of the connect descriptor in TNSNAMES.ORA.
/
12228, 00000, "TNS:protocol adapter not loadable"
// *Cause:  On some platforms (such as Windows) protocol support is loaded at
// run-time. If the shared library (or DLL) for the protocol adapter is
// missing or one of its supporting libraries is missing then this error is
// returned.
// *Action: For further details, turn on tracing and reexecute the operation.
// The trace file will include the name of the shared library (or DLL) that
// could not be loaded.
/
12229, 00000, "TNS:Interchange has no more free connections"
// *Cause:  One or more Interchanges along the path to the destination
// desired has no more free connections available to be used for this
// call.
// *Action: Try again later when the Interchanges are less busy, or contact
// your network administrator to have him determine which interchange it is,
// and increase the number of connections available on that interchange.
/
12230, 00000, "TNS:Severe Network error occurred in making this connection"
// *Cause: This error is reported by an interchange which fails to make
// contact with the destination due to a physical network error while calling
// a destination.
// *Action: Try again later when the network service may have been fixed
// or report the problem to your Network Administrator so that he may fix
// the problem.
/
12231, 00000, "TNS:No connection possible to destination"
// *Cause: This error is reported by an interchange which fails to find a
// possible connection along the path to the destination.
// *Action: Report the problem to your Network Administrator so that he may
// fix the problem.
/
12232, 00000, "TNS:No path available to destination"
// *Cause: This error is reported by an interchange which fails to find a
// possible path to the destination.
// *Action: Report the problem to your Network Administrator so that he may
// fix the problem.
/
12233, 00000, "TNS:Failure to accept a connection"
// *Cause: This error is reported by an interchange which fails to accept 
// a connection due to a redirect failure.
// *Action: Report the problem to your Network Administrator so that he may
// isolate the interchange problem.
/
12234, 00000, "TNS:Redirect to destination"
// *Cause: This error is reported by an interchange which determines that this
// interchange is not the right gateway and needs to redirect the connection
// to another gateway along the path to the destination.
// *Action: None.
/
12235, 00000, "TNS:Failure to redirect to destination"
// *Cause: This error is reported by an interchange which fails to redirect 
// a connection to another interchange along the path to the destination.
// *Action: Report the problem to your Network Administrator so that he may
// fix the problem.
/
12236, 00000, "TNS:protocol support not loaded"
// *Cause:  On some platforms (such as Windows) protocol support is loaded at
// run-time. If the shared library (or DLL) for the protocol adapter has not
// been loaded, then this error is returned.
// *Action: For further details, turn on tracing and reexecute the operation.
// The trace file will have the name of the shared library (or DLL) that has
// not been loaded.

12500, 00000, "TNS:listener failed to start a dedicated server process"
// *Cause:  The process of starting up a dedicated server process failed.
// The executable could not be found or the environment may be set up
// incorrectly.
// *Action: Turn on tracing at the ADMIN level and reexecute the operation.
// Verify that the ORACLE Server executable is present and has execute
// permissions enabled. Ensure that the ORACLE environment is specified
// correctly in LISTENER.ORA. The Oracle Protocol Adapter that is being 
// called may not be installed on the local hard drive.  Please check that
// the correct Protocol Adapter are successfully linked.
// If error persists, contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
12502, 00000, "TNS:listener received no CONNECT_DATA from client"
// *Cause:  No CONNECT_DATA was passed to the listener.
// *Action: Check that the service name resolved from TNSNAMES.ORA has
// the CONNECT_DATA component of the connect descriptor.
/
12504, 00000, "TNS:listener was not given the SERVICE_NAME in CONNECT_DATA"
// *Cause:  The listener was not configured with a default service and
//  SERVICE_NAME was missing from the CONNECT_DATA received by the listener.
// *Action: Possible solutions are:
//  - Configure DEFAULT_SERVICE parameter in LISTENER.ORA with a valid service
//    name. Reload the listener parameter file using reload [<listener_name>].
//    This should be done by the LISTENER administrator.
//  - If using a service name, Check that the connect descriptor corresponding
//    to the service name in TNSNAMES.ORA has a SERVICE_NAME or SID component
//    in the CONNECT_DATA.
/
12505, 00000, "TNS:listener does not currently know of SID given in connect descriptor"
// *Cause:  The listener received a request to establish a connection to a
// database or other service. The connect descriptor received by the listener
// specified a SID for an instance (usually a database instance) that either
// has not yet dynamically registered with the listener or has not been
// statically configured for the listener. This may be a temporary condition
// such as after the listener has started, but before the database instance
// has registered with the listener.
// *Action: 
//  - Wait a moment and try to connect a second time.
//  - Check which instances are currently known by the listener by executing:
//    lsnrctl services <listener name>
//  - Check that the SID parameter in the connect descriptor specifies
//    an instance known by the listener.
//  - Check for an event in the listener.log file.
/
12508, 00000, "TNS:listener could not resolve the COMMAND given"
// *Cause:  The COMMAND given to listener is not supported.
// *Action: This is not seen in normal use of Oracle Net.
// *Comment: Check the COMMAND given to listener. This error is probably
// caused by incompatible Oracle Net or Net8 versions.
// Do not include in error manual.
/
12509, 00000, "TNS:listener failed to redirect client to service handler"
// *Cause:  The dispatcher terminated unexpectedly
// *Action: Attempt to connect again and if the same error occurs,
// contact the DBA to check the state of the dispatchers for this SID.
// If the problem persists, turn on tracing in the listener to determine
// the TNS error caused by the redirect.
/
12510, 00000, "TNS:database temporarily lacks resources to handle the request"
// *Cause:  The dispatchers appear to be busy handling other requests.
// *Action: Attempt the connection again. If error persists, ask
// the DBA to increase the number of dispatchers and/or dispatchers' limit on 
// number of connections/sessions that they can accept.
/
12511, 00000, "TNS:service handler found but it is not accepting connections"
// *Cause:  The dispatchers notified the listener that they temporarily 
// do not accept new connections. 
// *Action: Attempt the connection again. If error persists, contact the DBA
// to check the state of the dispatchers and/or ask him to increase the number
// of dispatchers.
/
12513, 00000, "TNS:service handler found but it has registered for a different protocol"
// *Cause:  The dispatchers registered for this service are connected to
// the listener by way of a different network protocol than that of the client.
// *Action: Contact the DBA to register a dispatcher on your protocol.
/
12514, 00000, "TNS:listener does not currently know of service requested in connect descriptor"
// *Cause:  The listener received a request to establish a connection to a
// database or other service. The connect descriptor received by the listener
// specified a service name for a service (usually a database service)
// that either has not yet dynamically registered with the listener or has
// not been statically configured for the listener.  This may be a temporary
// condition such as after the listener has started, but before the database
// instance has registered with the listener.
// *Action: 
//  - Wait a moment and try to connect a second time.
//  - Check which services are currently known by the listener by executing:
//    lsnrctl services <listener name>
//  - Check that the SERVICE_NAME parameter in the connect descriptor of the
//    net service name used specifies a service known by the listener.
//  - If an easy connect naming connect identifier was used, check that
//    the service name specified is a service known by the listener.
//  - Check for an event in the listener.log file.
/
12515, 00000, "TNS:listener could not find a handler for this presentation"
// *Cause:  None of the listener's known service handlers are registered
// as supporting the presentation protocol required by the connecting client.
// *Action: Check that the destination service is configured to accept the
// presentation protocol.
/
12516, 00000, "TNS:listener could not find available handler with matching protocol stack"
// *Cause: None of the known and available service handlers for the given 
// SERVICE_NAME support the client's protocol stack: transport, session, 
// and presentation protocols.
// *Action: Check to make sure that the service handlers (e.g. dispatchers) 
// for the given SERVICE_NAME are registered with the listener, are accepting 
// connections, and that they are properly configured to support the desired 
// protocols.
/
12518, 00000, "TNS:listener could not hand off client connection"
// *Cause: The process of handing off a client connection to another process
// failed.
// *Action: Turn on listener tracing and re-execute the operation. Verify
// that the listener and database instance are properly configured for
// direct handoff.  If problem persists, call Oracle Support.
// *Comment: The problem can be worked around by configuring dispatcher(s)
// to specifically handle the desired presentation(s), and connecting
// directly to the dispatcher, bypassing the listener.
/
12519, 00000, "TNS:no appropriate service handler found"
// *Cause: The listener could not find any available service handlers that
// are appropriate for the client connection.
// *Action: Run "lsnrctl services" to ensure that the instance(s) have
// registered with the listener, and are accepting connections.
/
12520, 00000, "TNS:listener could not find available handler for requested type of server"
// *Cause: None of the known and available service handlers for requested type 
// of server (dedicated or shared) are appropriate for the client connection.
// *Action: Run "lsnrctl services" to ensure that the instance(s) have
// registered with the listener and that the appropriate handlers are 
// accepting connections. 
/
12521, 00000, "TNS:listener does not currently know of instance requested in connect descriptor"
// *Cause:  The listener received a request to establish a connection to a
// database or other service. The connect descriptor received by the listener
// specified in addition to the service name an instance name for an instance
// (usually a database instance) that either has not yet dynamically registered
// with the listener or has not been statically configured for the listener.
// This may be a temporary condition such as after the listener has started,
// but before the database instance has registered with the listener.
// *Action: 
//  - Wait a moment and try to connect a second time.
//  - Check which instances are currently known by the listener by executing:
//    lsnrctl services <listener name>
//  - Check that the INSTANCE_NAME parameter in the connect descriptor specifies
//    an instance name known by the listener.
//  - Check for an event in the listener.log file.
/
12522, 00000, "TNS:listener could not find available instance with given INSTANCE_ROLE"
// *Cause: There are not any available and appropriate database instances 
// registered with the listener, that are part of the service identified by 
// SERVICE_NAME given in the connect descriptor and that have the specified 
// INSTANCE_ROLE (and INSTANCE_NAME, if specified). 
// *Action: Check to make sure that the INSTANCE_ROLE specified is correct. 
// Run "lsnrctl services" to ensure that the instance(s) have registered with 
// the listener and that they are ready to accept connections.
/
12523, 00000, "TNS:listener could not find instance appropriate for the client connection"
// *Cause:  The listener could not find any available (database) instances, 
// that are appropriate for the client connection.
// *Action: Run "lsnrctl services" to ensure that the instance(s) are
// registered with the listener, and have status READY.
/
12524, 00000, "TNS:listener could not resolve HANDLER_NAME given in connect descriptor"
// *Cause: The HANDLER_NAME in the CONNECT_DATA was not found in the listener's
// tables for the specified SERVICE_NAME and INSTANCE_NAME.
// *Action: Check to make sure that the HANDLER_NAME specified is correct.
// *Comment: This error will be returned if the database instance and/or its
// service handlers have not been registered with the listener or they have
// been registered for different service; the instance may need to be started.
/
12525, 00000, "TNS:listener has not received client's request in time allowed"
// *Cause: The listener disconnected the client because the client failed to
// provide the necessary connect information within the allowed time interval.
// This may be a result of network or system delays; or this may indicate that a
// malicious client is trying to cause a Denial of Service attack on the
// listener.
// *Action: If the error occurred because of a slow network or system,
// reconfigure INBOUND_CONNECT_TIMEOUT to a larger value. If a malicious
// client is suspected, use the address in listener.log to identify the
// source and restrict access. Turn on tracing for more information.
// *Comment: The logged address in listener.ora may not be reliable as it
// can be forged at the lower networking layers (e.g. in the case of TCP/IP).
/
12526, 00000, "TNS:listener: all appropriate instances are in restricted mode"
// *Cause:  Database instances supporting the service requested by the client
// were in restricted mode. The Listener does not allow connections to 
// instances in restricted mode. This condition may be temporary, such as 
// during periods when database administration is performed.
// *Action: Attempt the connection again. If error persists, then contact
// the database administrator to change the mode of the instance, 
// if appropriate.
/
12527, 00000, "TNS:listener: all instances are in restricted mode or blocking new connections"
// *Cause:  All appropriate database instances supporting the service requested
// by the client reported that they either were in restricted mode or were 
// blocking the new connections. The Listener does not allow connections to 
// such instances. This condition may be temporary, such as at instance 
// startup.
// *Action: Attempt the connection again. If error persists, then contact the 
// database administrator to check the status of the instances. 
/
12528, 00000, "TNS:listener: all appropriate instances are blocking new connections"
// *Cause:  All instances supporting the service requested by the client 
// reported that they were blocking the new connections. This condition may be
// temporary, such as at instance startup. 
// *Action: Attempt the connection again. If error persists, then contact the
// administrator to check the status of the instances.
/
12529, 00000, "TNS:connect request rejected based on current filtering rules"
// *Cause: Connection Manager and its listener were configured with filtering 
// rules specifying that the connect request be rejected.
// *Action: If this connect request should be allowed, then contact the 
// administrator to modify the filtering rules.

/
12531, 00000, "TNS:cannot allocate memory"
// *Cause:  Sufficient memory could not be allocated to perform the desired
// activity.
// *Action:  Either free some resource for TNS, or add more memory to the
// machine. For further details, turn on tracing and reexecute the operation.
/
12532, 00000, "TNS:invalid argument"
// *Cause:  An internal function received an invalid parameter.
// *Action: Not normally visible to the user. For further details, turn
// on tracing and reexecute the operation. If error persists, contact
// Oracle Customer Support.
/
12533, 00000, "TNS:illegal ADDRESS parameters"
// *Cause: An illegal set of protocol adapter parameters was specified. In
// some cases, this error is returned when a connection cannot be made to the
// protocol transport.
// *Action: Verify that the destination can be reached using the specified
// protocol. Check the parameters within the ADDRESS section of
// TNSNAMES.ORA.  Legal ADDRESS parameter formats may be found in the
// Oracle operating system specific documentation for your platform.
// Protocols that resolve names at the transport layer (such as DECnet object
// names) are vulnerable to this error if not properly configured or names are
// misspelled.
/
12534, 00000, "TNS:operation not supported"
// *Cause:  An internal function received a request to perform an
// operation that is not supported (on this machine).
// *Action:  Not normally visible to the user. For further details, turn
// on tracing and reexecute the operation. If error persists, contact
// Oracle Customer Support.
/
12535, 00000, "TNS:operation timed out"
// *Cause: The requested operation could not be completed within the time out

// *Action: Look at the documentation on the secondary errors for possible
// remedy. See SQLNET.LOG to find secondary error if not provided explicitly.
// Turn on tracing to gather more information.
/
12536, 00000, "TNS:operation would block"
// *Cause: An internal operation did not commence because to do so would
// block the current process and the user has requested that operations be
// non-blocking.
// *Action:  None needed; this is an information message.
/
12537, 00000, "TNS:connection closed"
// *Cause: "End of file" condition has been reached; partner has disconnected.
// *Action: None needed; this is an information message.
/
12538, 00000, "TNS:no such protocol adapter"
// *Cause: The protocol adapter requested (by way of the "(PROTOCOL=..)"
// keyword-value pair in a TNS address) is unknown. If the supplied address
// is typographically correct then the protocol adapter is not installed.
// *Action: Install the protocol adapter or correct typographically error,
// as appropriate.  Note: if the supplied address was derived from
// resolving the service name, check the address in the appropriate file
// (TNSNAMES.ORA, LISTENER.ORA or SQLNET.ORA).
/
12539, 00000, "TNS:buffer over- or under-flow"
// *Cause: Buffer too small for incoming data or too large for outgoing data.
// *Action:  This restriction (which is associated with CONNECT DATA) is not
// normally visible to the user. For further details, turn on tracing and
// reexecute the operation; contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
12540, 00000, "TNS:internal limit restriction exceeded"
// *Cause: Too many TNS connections open simultaneously.
// *Action: Wait for connections to close and re-try.
/
12541, 00000, "TNS:no listener"
// *Cause: The connection request could not be completed because the listener
// is not running.
// *Action: Ensure that the supplied destination address matches one of
// the addresses used by the listener - compare the TNSNAMES.ORA entry with
// the appropriate LISTENER.ORA file (or TNSNAV.ORA if the connection is to
// go by way of an Interchange). Start the listener on the remote machine.
/
12542, 00000, "TNS:address already in use"
// *Cause: Specified listener address is already being used.
// *Action: Start your listener with a unique address.
/
12543, 00000, "TNS:destination host unreachable"
// *Cause: Contact can not be made with remote party.
// *Action: Make sure the network driver is functioning and the network is up.
/
12544, 00000, "TNS:contexts have different wait/test functions"
// *Cause: Two protocol adapters have conflicting wait/test functions.
// *Action:  Not normally visible to the user. For further details, turn
// on tracing and reexecute the operation. If error persists, contact
// Oracle Customer Support.
/
12545, 00000, "Connect failed because target host or object does not exist"
// *Cause: The address specified is not valid, or the program being 
// connected to does not exist.
// *Action: Ensure the ADDRESS parameters have been entered correctly; the
// most likely incorrect parameter is the node name.  Ensure that the 
// executable for the server exists (perhaps "oracle" is missing.)
// If the protocol is TCP/IP, edit the TNSNAMES.ORA file to change the
// host name to a numeric IP address and try again.
/
12546, 00000, "TNS:permission denied"
// *Cause: User has insufficient privileges to perform the requested operation.

// *Cause:  An operation requested by a user is not supported by the native
//          services component.
// *Action: This may be an internal error if the operation should have been
//          supported.
/
12631, 00000, "Username retrieval failed"
// *Cause:  The authentication service failed to retrieve the name of a user.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine which routine is failing.
/

//          roles.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine which routine is failing.
/
12633, 00000, "No shared authentication services"
// *Cause:  The list of authentication services specified by the user does not
//          match those supported by the process.
// *Action: Either specify another list or relink the executable with the
//          desired services.
/

//          not authentication is required was set to true.
// *Action: Either disable the parameter or relink the executable with service
//          adapters.
/
12636, 00000, "Packet send failed"
// *Cause:  A process was unable to send a packet to another process.
//          Possible causes are:
//          1. The other process was terminated.
//          2. The machine on which the other process is running went down.
//          3. Some other communications error occurred.
// *Action: If the cause is not obvious, contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
12637, 00000, "Packet receive failed"
// *Cause:  A process was unable to receive a packet from another process.
//          Possible causes are:
//          1. The other process was terminated.
//          2. The machine on which the other process is running went down.

/
12638, 00000, "Credential retrieval failed"
// *Cause:  The authentication service failed to retrieve the credentials of a
//          user.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine the exact error.
/
12639, 00000, "Authentication service negotiation failed"
// *Cause:  No match was found between the types of authentication services
//          that the client supports and those that the server is using.
// *Action: Possible solutions:
//          1. Change the entry in sqlnet.ora that determines which services
//             are to be used.
//          2. Relink the client with at least one of the authentication
//             service adapters that the server supports.
//          3. Relink the server with at least one of the authentication
//             service adapters that the client supports.
//          4. Disable authentication on both the client and server.
/
12640, 00000, "Authentication adapter initialization failed"
// *Cause:  The function specified in the authentication table entry for the
//          service failed.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine the exact error.
/
12641, 00000, "Authentication service failed to initialize"
// *Cause:  The authentication service failed during initialization.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine the exact error.
/
12642, 00000, "No session key"
// *Cause:  A process has no session key associated with it because the
//          authentication service being used does not use one.
// *Action: If a session key is required, use another authentication service.
/
12643, 00000, "Client received internal error from server"
// *Cause:  The client process received an error from the server that indicated
//          that an internal Oracle Net native services error had occurred.
// *Action: Enable tracing on both processes and attempt to recreate the
//          problem. If successful in recreating the problem, contact Oracle
//          Customer Support.
/
12645, 00000, "Parameter does not exist."
// *Cause:  A sqlnet.ora parameter from which a value was needed does not
//          exist.
// *Action: Set the parameter in the parameter file.
/
12646, 00000, "Invalid value specified for boolean parameter"
// *Cause:  The value specified for a parameter was set to a value other than
//          true/false or on/off.
// *Action: Correct the value of the parameter.
/
12647, 00000, "Authentication required"
// *Cause:  The parameter that controls whether authentication is required was
//          set to true, but the executable does not have an
//          authentication service linked in.
// *Action: Either re-link the executable with an authentication service
//          adapter or disable the parameter.
/
12648, 00000, "Encryption or data integrity algorithm list empty"
// *Cause:  An Oracle Advanced Security list-of-algorithms parameter was empty, e.g.
//          "()".
// *Action: Change the list to contain the name of at least one
//          installed algorithm, or remove the list entirely if every
//          installed algorithm is acceptable.
/
12649, 00000, "Unknown encryption or data integrity algorithm"
// *Cause:  An Oracle Advanced Security list-of-algorithms parameter included an
//          algorithm name that was not recognized.
// *Action: Either remove that algorithm name, correct it if it was
//          misspelled, or install the driver for the missing
//          algorithm.
/
12650, 00000, "No common encryption or data integrity algorithm"
// *Cause:  The client and server have no algorithm in common for
//          either encryption or data integrity or both.
// *Action: Choose sets of algorithms that overlap.  In other words,
//          add one of the client's algorithm choices to the server's
//          list or vice versa.
/
12651, 00000, "Encryption or data integrity algorithm unacceptable"
// *Cause:  The algorithm the server chose to use for encryption or
//          data integrity was not one of the choices acceptable to
//          the client.  This is either the result of an internal
//          error, of a network data transmission error, or of
//          deliberate tampering with the transmitted data.
// *Action: For further details, turn on tracing, re-execute the
//          operation, and contact Oracle Customer Support.
/
12652, 00000, "String truncated"
// *Cause:  Not enough memory was allocated for a string so it had to be
//          truncated
// *Action: If it is OK that the string is truncated, then it is not an
//          error. Otherwise, call the routine that reported the error
//          again with a larger string buffer.
/
12653, 00000, "Authentication control function failed"
// *Cause:  The control function utilized by the authentication service driver
//          failed.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine the exact error.
/
12654, 00000, "Authentication conversion failed"
// *Cause:  The authentication service was unable to convert the credentials
//          of a user from the format specific to the format into the
//          ORACLE format.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine the exact error.
/
12655, 00000, "Password check failed"
// *Cause:  The authentication service being used was unable to verify the
//          provided password.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine the exact error.
/
12656, 00000, "Cryptographic checksum mismatch"
// *Cause:  The cryptographic checksum received with a packet of
// 	    incoming data didn't match the checksum computed by the
// 	    receiving end.  This indicates that the packet was
// 	    tampered with or otherwise corrupted in transit.
// *Action: Look for sources of data corruption, perhaps including
// 	    deliberate tampering.
/
12657, 00000, "No algorithms installed"
// *Cause:  The near side of the connection required the use of a
// 	    service (either encryption or checksumming) when no
// 	    algorithms for that service were installed.
// *Action: Remove the "ON" requirement for that service.
/
12658, 00000, "ANO service required but TNS version is incompatible"
// *Cause:  A client process that is running an earlier version of TNS
//          attempted to connect but the connection failed because the server
//          process required that an ANO service (authentication, encryption,
//          etc.) be used.
// *Action: Relink the calling executable and retry the connection or eliminate
//          the requirement that the service be used on the server side.
/
12659, 00000, "Error received from other process"
// *Cause:  An error was received by one or more services from the process on
//          the other side of the connection.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine the exact error(s).
//          The error(s) is (are) not returned directly because an error
//          generated by a server may not make sense on the client side and
//          vice-versa.
/
12660, 00000, "Encryption or crypto-checksumming parameters incompatible"
// *Cause:  One side of the connection specified "REQUIRED" for encryption
//	    or crypto-checksumming, while the other side specified "REJECTED".
// *Action: Change the "REQUIRED" side to "REQUESTED" if the
//	    you want encryption or crypto-checksumming to be optional, or
//	    change the "REJECTED" side to "ACCEPTED" if you do not
//	    want the service to be optional.
/
12661, 00000, "Protocol authentication to be used"
// *Cause:  The Oracle Advanced Security authentication service has determined
//          that the Oracle Net transport protocol in use is to be utilized to
//          authenticate a user's identity.
// *Action: This error is used solely to communicate information between the
//          authentication service and the Oracle Net session layer and should not
//          normally be visible.
//          If the error is seen, contact Oracle Worldwide Support.
/
12662, 00000, "proxy ticket retrieval failed"
// *Cause:  The authentication adapter used by Oracle Net failed to retrieve the
//          credentials needed to authenticate a database link.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine the exact error.
/
12663, 00000, "Services required by client not available on the server"
// *Cause:  Service(s) that was (were) required by the client process were not
//          available on the server process.
// *Action: Configure the server with the services required by the client (best
//          solution) or delete the requirement from the configuration
//          file of the client (least secure).
/
12664, 00000, "Services required by server not available on the client"
// *Cause:  Service(s) that was (were) required by the server process were not
//          available on the client process.
// *Action: Configure the client with the services required by the server (best
//          solution) or delete the requirement from the configuration
//          file of the server (least secure).
/
12665, 00000, "NLS string open failed"
// *Cause:  A native service was unable to make a string available for use by
//          the National Language Support component.
// *Action: Make sure the National Language Support component has been
//          properly. If it has, enable tracing and report the problem
//          to Customer Support.
/
12666, 00000, "Dedicated server: outbound transport protocol different from inbound"
// *Cause:  The protocol specified for an externally-identified outbound
//          connection from a dedicated server (database link) was not the same
//          as that used for the inbound connection. It is not possible for
//          Oracle Net to authenticate a proxy connection that uses a protocol
//          that is different from that which was used for the connection to
//          the dedicated server.
// *Action: Specify the same protocol in the Oracle Net connect descriptor
//          for the outbound connection as that used for the inbound
//          connection.
/
12667, 00000, "Shared server: outbound transport protocol different from inbound"
// *Cause:  The protocol specified for an externally-identified outbound
//          connection from a shared server (database link) was not the same as
//          as that used for the inbound connection. It is not possible for
//          Oracle Net to authenticate a proxy connection that uses a protocol
//          that is different from that which was used for the connection to
//          the shared server.
// *Action: Specify the same protocol in the Oracle Net connect descriptor
//          for the outbound connection as that used for the inbound
//          connection
/
12668, 00000, "Dedicated server: outbound protocol does not support proxies"
// *Cause:  The protocol specified to perform an externally-identified proxy
//          connection (database link) from a dedicated server does
//          not support proxy connections.
// *Action: Specify a protocol in the Oracle Net connect descriptor used for
//          the connection that does support externally-authenticated proxy 
//          connections.
//          NOTE: Because of a limitation in Oracle Net, the protocol used for
//                the proxy connection must the same as that used for the
//                connection from the client to the server.
/
12669, 00000, "Shared server: outbound protocol does not support proxies"
// *Cause:  The protocol specified to perform an externally-identified proxy
//          connection (database link) from a shared server does not support
//          proxy connections.
// *Action: Specify a protocol in the Oracle Net connect descriptor used for
//          the connection that does support externally-authenticated proxy 
//          connections.
//          NOTE: Because of a limitation in  Oracle Net, the protocol used for
//                the proxy connection must the same as that used for the
//                connection from the client to the server.
/
12670, 00000, "Incorrect role password"
// *Cause:  A password supplied for a role could not be validated by the
//          authentication service.
// *Action: Supply the correct password.
/
12671, 00000, "Shared server: adapter failed to save context"
// *Cause:  The adapter for the authentication service failed when it tried to
//          save the data needed for proxy connections (database
//          links) through the shared server.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine the exact error. Contact Oracle
//          Customer Support if the reason is not obvious.
/
12672, 00000, "Database logon failure"
// *Cause:  The authentication service adapter in use encountered an error
//          it attempted to validate the logon attempt of a user.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine the exact error encountered by the
//          adapter.
/
12673, 00000, "Dedicated server: context not saved"
// *Cause:  A connection was marked as being a proxy connection (database link)
//          from a dedicated server but no inbound context was present.
// *Action: This error should not normally be visible to the user. Contact
//          Oracle Customer Support.
/
12674, 00000, "Shared server: proxy context not saved"
// *Cause:  A connection was marked as being a proxy connection (database link)

// *Action: This error should not normally be visible to the user. Contact
//          Oracle Customer Support.
/
12675, 00000, "External user name not available yet"
// *Cause:  The authentication service in use was not able to return the
//          external name of a user of the ORACLE server because it is not
//          available to the service yet.
// *Action: This is just an informational message and should not normally be
//          visible to the user. If the error does appear, contact Oracle
//          Customer Support.
/
12676, 00000, "Server received internal error from client"
// *Cause:  The server process received an error from the client which
//          indicated that an internal Oracle Net native services error had
//          occurred.
// *Action: Enable tracing on both processes and attempt to recreate the
//          problem. If the problem recurs, contact Oracle Customer
//          Support.
/
12677, 00000, "Authentication service not supported by database link"
// *Cause:  The authentication service used by the proxy process (database
//          link) was unable to find the adapter being used by the client
//          in its list of authentication mechanisms.
// *Action: Specify an authentication adapter that is shared by the client and
//          the server being used for the database link.
/
12678, 00000, "Authentication disabled but required"
// *Cause:  The configuration parameters that control whether Oracle Advanced
//          Security authentication is disabled or required were both set to TRUE.
// *Action: Set one or both of the parameters to FALSE.

12679, 00000, "Native services disabled by other process but required"
// *Cause:  The remote process has disabled native services but the local
//          process requires them.
// *Action: Enable native services on the remote process or disable them
//          locally.
/
12680, 00000, "Native services disabled but required"
// *Cause:  The process has disabled native services but at least one service
//          is required.
// *Action: Enable native services or change the configuration file so that
//          none of the available services are required.
/
12681, 00000, "Login failed: the SecurID card does not have a pincode yet"
// *Cause:  The SecurID card that is used to logon to Oracle, does not have
//          a pincode assigned to it.
// *Action: Use one of the programs supplied by Security Dynamics to assign
//          a pincode to the card. 
/
12682, 00000, "Login failed: the SecurID card is in next PRN mode"
// *Cause:  The SecurID card and the SecurID server are out of sync and the
//          server requires the next cardcode to resynchronize the card.
// *Action: Use one of the programs supplied by Security Dynamics to 
//          resynchronize the SecurID card. 
/
12683, 00000, "encryption/crypto-checksumming: no Diffie-Hellman seed"
// *Cause:  The "sqlnet.crypto_seed" parameter is missing from the
//          SQLNET.ORA parameters file for Oracle Advanced Security.
// *Action: Add this line to SQLNET.ORA:
//	      sqlnet.crypto_seed = "randomly-chosen text"
/
12684, 00000, "encryption/crypto-checksumming: Diffie-Hellman seed too small"
// *Cause:  The "sqlnet.crypto_seed" parameter in the SQLNET.ORA
//          parameter file for Oracle Advanced Security is too small.
// *Action: Add more randomly-chosen text to it, perhaps using Network
//          Manager.
/
12685, 00000, "Native service required remotely but disabled locally"
// *Cause:  A native service is required by the remote process but native
//          services have been disabled locally.
// *Action: Enable native services locally or change the configuration
//          parameters on the remote host so that no native services are
//          required.
/
12686, 00000, "Invalid command specified for a service"
// *Cause:  An operation which does not exist was specified for a native
//          service.
// *Action: This is a programming error and should not normally be visible to
//          the user. If the error does appear, contact Oracle Customer
//          Support.
/
12687, 00000, "Credentials expired."
// *Cause:  The credentials that are used to authenticate the user for the
//          requested connection have expired.
// *Action: Renew your credentials. Refer to the documentation specific for
//          your Network Authentication Adapter on how to do this.
/
12688, 00000, "Login failed: the SecurID server rejected the new pincode"
// *Cause:  There are a number of reasons why the SecurID server would refuse
//          a pincode:
//          - The user might not have permission to make up his own pincode.
//          - The pincode was either too short or too long. Valid pincodes
//            consist of minimal four, but no more than eight characters.
//          - The pincode contains any non alphanumeric characters.
// *Action: Reexecute the operation and make sure to use a pincode that
//          satisfies the above requirements. If the problem persists, turn 
//          on tracing at the Oracle Server side of the connection and 
//          examine the trace file for the exact error.
/
12689, 00000, "Server Authentication required, but not supported"
// *Cause:  Server Authentication is required for this connection, but not
//          supported by both sides of the connection.
// *Action: Make sure both sides of the connection have the correct version of
//          Advanced Networking Option, and that the Authentication Adapter
//          supports Server Authentication.
/
12690, 00000, "Server Authentication failed, login cancelled"
// *Cause:  Server Authentication is required, but the server's credentials
//          were found invalid by the client.
// *Action: Make sure that the server has a valid set of credentials. Refer to
//          your authentication adapter specific documentation on how to do
//          this.
/
12696, 00000, "Double Encryption Turned On, login disallowed"
// *Cause:  The user is using a Secure Protocol Adapter that has Encryption
//          turned ON as well as ANO Encryption.
// *Action: Turn OFF either ANO Encryption or the Protocol Adapter Encryption
//          if possible. Refer to Oracle Advanced Security Administrator's 
//          Guide on how to do this.
/
12699, 00000, "Native service internal error"
// *Cause:  An internal error occurred in the native services component.
// *Action: Enable tracing to determine the exact error. Contact Oracle
//          Customer Support.
