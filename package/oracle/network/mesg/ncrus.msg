//          version level of the remote application.
// *Action: Link remote application with latest NCR library.
/
3014, 00000, "NCRO: Bad transport address"
// *Cause:  A service context cannot be created because the transport
//          address descriptor (contained in the binding context) is

// *Cause:  Attempt to initialize the Core thread package has failed.
// *Action: Internal error - contact customer support.
/
3020, 00000, "NCRO: Invalid call context"
// *Cause:  The call context is not an valid call context.
// *Action: Call context was destroyed, probably because the Break was
//          received
